",1900,"Friedrich Ernst Dorn ","Radon decays into radioactive polonium and alpha particles. This emitted radiation made radon useful in cancer therapy. Radon was used in some hospitals to treat tumours by sealing the gas in minute tubes, and implanting these into the tumour, treating the disease in situ. Other, safer treatments are now more commonly used. In some places, high concentrations of radon can build up indoors, escaping from the ground or from granite buildings. Home testing kits are available which can be sent away for analysis.","Radon is responsible for the majority of the mean public exposure to ionizing radiation. It is often the single largest contributor to an individual's background radiation dose, and is the most variable from location to location. Radon gas from natural sources can accumulate in buildings, especially in confined areas such as attics, and basements. It can also be found in some spring waters and hot springs. According to a 2003 report EPA's Assessment of Risks from Radon in Homes from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, epidemiological evidence shows a clear link between lung cancer and high concentrations of radon, with 21,000 radon-induced U.S. lung cancer deaths per year—second only to cigarette smoking. Thus in geographic areas where radon is present in heightened concentrations, radon is considered a significant indoor air contaminant.","Radon has no known biological role. It is, however, thought that it may have had a significant role in evolution. This is because it is responsible for much of the Earth’s background radiation that can lead to genetic modifications.",0,0,,,,,,
